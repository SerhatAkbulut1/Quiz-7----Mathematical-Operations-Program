# Mathematical Operations Program

This Java program performs various mathematical operations, including calculating Armstrong numbers, Emirp numbers, generating number sequences in ascending or descending order, and identifying abundant numbers.

# Experiment Overview

The program provides the following functionalities:

1-Calculating Armstrong numbers: Armstrong numbers are n-digit numbers where the sum of the nth power of each digit is equal to the original number. The program will accept an input value and list all Armstrong numbers up to that value.

2-Calculating Emirp numbers: Emirp numbers are prime numbers that remain prime when their digits are reversed. The program will accept an input value and list all Emirp numbers up to that value.

3-Calculating Abundant numbers: Abundant numbers are numbers for which the sum of their proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The program will accept an input value and list all Abundant numbers up to that value.

4-Sorting: The program can generate an array of integers from numbers provided in a file and sort them in either ascending or descending order. The program will print the sorted
